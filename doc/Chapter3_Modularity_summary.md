1. Distinguish between declarations (used as interfaces) and definitions (used as implementations);
2. Prefer modules over headers (where modules are supported);
3. Use header files to represent interfaces and to emphasize logical structure;
4. #include a header in the source file that implements its functions;
5. Avoid non-inline function definitions in headers;
6. Use namespaces to express logical structure;
7. Use using-directives for transition, for foundational libraries (such as std), or within a local scope;
8. Don’t put a using-directive in a header file; 
9. Pass ‘small’ values by value and ‘large‘ values by reference;
10. Prefer pass-by-const-reference over plain pass-by-reference;
11. Return values as function-return values (rather than by out-parameters);
12. Don’t overuse return-type deduction;
13. Don’t overuse structured binding; a named return type often gives more readable code;
