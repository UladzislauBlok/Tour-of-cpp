1. An STL algorithm operates on one or more sequences;
2. An input sequence is half-open and defined by a pair of iterators;
3. You can define your own iterators to serve special needs;
4. Many algorithms can be applied to I/O streams;
5. When searching, an algorithm usually returns the end of the input sequence to indicate 'not found';
6. Algorithms do not directly add or subtract elements from their argument sequences;
7. When writing a loop, consider whether it could be expressed as a general algorithm;
8. Use using-type-aliases to clean up messy notation;
9. Use predicates and other function objects to give standard algorithms a wider range of meanings;
10. A predicate must not modify its argument;
11. Know your standard-library algorithms and prefer them to hand-crafted loops;
