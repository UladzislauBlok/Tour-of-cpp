1. Prefer well-defined user-defined types over built-in types when the built-in types are too low-level;
2. Organize related data into structures (structs or classes);
3. Represent the distinction between an interface and an implementation using a class;
4. A struct is simply a class with its members public by default;
5. Define constructors to guarantee and simplify initialization of classes;
6. Use enumerations to represent sets of named constants;
7. Prefer class enums over ‘plain’ enums to minimize surprises;
8. Define operations on enumerations for safe and simple use;
9. Avoid ‘naked’ unions; wrap them in a class together with a type field;
10. Prefer std::variant to ‘naked unions’;
